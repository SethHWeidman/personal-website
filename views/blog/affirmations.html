<h1>Character Strengths Affirmations Practice</h1>

<p class="post-date">November 24, 2024</p>

<p>
  We spend much of our lives trying to solve problems in specific areas of our life:
  getting ahead professionally, improving one's relationships, and so on.
</p>

<p>
  While clearly important, one's "fundamentals" or "character" have a huge impact on
  success in these domains; "character is destiny", as the saying goes. This is one of
  the main reasons religious practice has enduring popularity: it constitutes dedicated
  time to focus on character improvement.
</p>

<p>
  What should we study during this time? We could study to be better Christians or Jews;
  while fine options, organized religion has too many negative associations for many.
</p>

<p>
  My search for a non-religious character improvement practice led me to a subfield of
  academic psychology known as "positive psychology", which studies how to help mentally
  healthy people live more fulfilling lives (the rest of psychology deals with helping
  less-mentally healthy individuals regain their mental health). This field has arrived
  at a list of 24 "character strengths", grouped into six categories, that lead to living
  a fulfilling life. Here are ChatGPT's descriptions of the six categories and 24
  individual strenghts:
</p>

<div class="character-strengths">
  <h3>Group 1: Wisdom and Knowledge</h3>
  <p>
    This group includes strengths that involve acquiring and using knowledge effectively.

    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Group 3: Humanity</h3>
  <p>Humanity consists of strengths related to relationships and caring for others.</p>
  <ol start="10">
    <li>
      <strong>Love</strong> – Valuing close relationships with others and showing warmth,
      empathy, and care.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Kindness</strong> – Helping and doing favors for others, motivated by

    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Social Intelligence</strong> – Being aware of the motives and feelings of

    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Group 4: Justice</h3>
  <p>
    Justice involves strengths that contribute to healthy community and group dynamics.
  </p>
  <ol start="13">
    <li>
      <strong>Teamwork</strong> – Excelling in collaborative roles and valuing group
      success over individual gain.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Fairness</strong> – Treating all people equally, without prejudice or
      favoritism.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Leadership</strong> – Encouraging a group to achieve goals while
      maintaining positive relationships.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Group 5: Temperance</h3>
  <p>
    Temperance is about exercising self-control and moderation to protect against excess.
  </p>
  <ol start="16">
    <li>
      <strong>Forgiveness</strong> – Letting go of resentment and offering second chances
      to those who have wronged you.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Humility</strong> – Not seeking the spotlight and being aware of one's
      limitations.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Prudence</strong> – Making careful, thoughtful choices and avoiding
      unnecessary risks.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Self-Regulation</strong> – Exercising control over one's emotions,
      impulses, and behaviors.
    </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Group 6: Transcendence</h3>
  <p>
    Transcendence encompasses strengths that connect individuals to the larger universe
    and provide meaning.
  </p>
  <ol start="20">
    <li>
      <strong>Appreciation of Beauty and Excellence</strong> – Noticing and valuing
      beauty, skill, and excellence in various domains.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Gratitude</strong> – Being aware of and thankful for the good things that
      happen.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Hope</strong> – Expecting the best in the future and working to achieve it.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Humor</strong> – Seeing the lighter side of life, often in ways that bring
      smiles to others.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Spirituality</strong> – Having a sense of purpose and connection to
      something greater than oneself.
    </li>
  </ol>
</div>

<p>
  The claim is that each of these is "universally recognized": taking the last two of
  these I've studied, Fairness and Self-Regulation, this means that someone showing
  exceptionally fair and equal treatment of those around him, or someone showing
  exceptional control over one's impulses and emotions, would be lauded for these
  character strengths in most of the world's cultures.
</p>

<h2>My practice</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    Each day, I pick one of these mostly at random (I actually balance the strengths so
    that I'm equally likely to choose a strength from any of the six categories).
  </li>
  <li>
    I then use LLM-based tools to generate "affirmations" related to the character
    strength.
  </li>
  <li>I copy these down by hand, and then reflect on them for a few minutes.</li>
</ol>

<p>
  Today, for example, the character strength I'm reviewing is "Hope" (part of
  "Transcendence"); the five affirmations that I've written by hand to reinforce this
  character strength are:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    I am optimistic about what tomorrow brings and work diligently toward my goals.
  </li>
  <li>Every challenge is an opportunity for growth, and I embrace it with hope.</li>
  <li>I focus on solutions and remain hopeful in all circumstances.</li>
  <li>My positive attitude attracts positive results.</li>
  <li>Each day is a new chance to move closer to my dreams.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Conclusion and next steps</h2>

<p>
  This practice has made me reflect deeply and holistically on what it means to be a good
  person and consistently pushes me to be better.
</p>

<p>
  If you're interested in participating in this practice, I'm happy to send you
  affirmations on a daily basis. I would like to grow an online community of individuals
  who participate; when a few of you join (as of this writing it's just me) I will create
  a Discord for us to keep in touch. I look forward to this practice enriching other
  people's lives as it has enriched my own.
